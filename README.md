# AI-Based-CV-Evaluator-Aligned-with-Job-Descriptions
Description:

Built a Python application that evaluates candidate CVs against job descriptions by extracting key skills, experience, and education criteria using regex and token-based matching. The tool accepts CVs in PDF and DOCX formats, processes them to identify relevant keywords, matches those with dynamically extracted job requirements, and computes a comprehensive match score.

Key Features:

🔍 Dynamic Criteria Extraction: Automatically extracts required skills, experience range, and education from free-text job descriptions using regex and text parsing.

📂 Multi-format CV Support: Parses resumes in PDF and DOCX formats.

📊 Scoring System: Calculates weighted match scores based on skill overlap, years of experience, and education alignment.

⚙️ Stopword Filtering: Removes generic and irrelevant terms to improve match accuracy.

🌐 Interactive Interface: Implemented with Streamlit for ease of use and fast evaluations.
